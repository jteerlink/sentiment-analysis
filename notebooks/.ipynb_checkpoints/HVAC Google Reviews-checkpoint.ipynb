       "\"ARS Charleston SC, are terrible with poor office customer service--Repairman came July 3rd --needed a new condenser coil on my Rheem 3 yr old 15 sear AC unit--had to order part. After a number of calls to see status of part I'm told no part till 8th, then 15th. finally called Corp Offices---Brittany Lee is my hero, she worked hard to get part and also had ARS bring me a portable Ac to help cool my 90-95 degree house. When the part couldn't be found she had a new unit put in @ minimal cost. She returned calls, keep me informed as things told place, and followed up, She is the only bright spot in this whole situation--Charleston ARC in my opinion is the pits\""
